##### Introduction

This analysis is to explore the relationship between happiness and temperature, which are both significant aspects of human well-being and environmental conditions. While it is impossible to assume happiness as a function of temperature alone, it could be a partial predictor of happiness along with other variables based on geopolitics and socio-economic factors.

As research has shown a significant association between temperature, violent crimes, and mortality rates, my hypothesis is that there is either a direct or indirect relationship between happiness and temperature. In the study from [world happiness](https://worldhappiness.report/data/)(2019) data, the following predictors are included.

| GDP per capita | Social support | Healthy life expectancy | Freedom to make life choices | Generosity | Perceptions of corruption |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |

In different regions, there could be varying climates and cultural attitudes towards weather.

People from colder regions would generally find warm weather pleasant while those in already hot climates might suffer during hotter periods, leading to a negative correlation. We will try to study the relationship for all countries, regions, individual country and group them based on the nature of relationship to see if there are any interesting patterns. A lack of correlation might imply that other factors are more influential on happiness in certain regions.

This could help policymakers in urban planning and public health as they can develop infrastructures suited to enhance happiness of citizens. Moreover, countries with a positive correlation might leverage their climate to boost tourism, promoting their warm weather as a happiness enhancer for those in colder climates.
